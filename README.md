I'm reading the pre-publication edition of [Deep Learning Design Patterns](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-design-patterns)
which uses Tensorflow-Keras as it's Python framework.  I usually work in Pytorch, so part of digesting the book for me is reworking all the
examples in Pytorch.  This repo is my lab for that and I'm sharing it in case it helps someone else. Each network type is placed in a folder
by type has both a Pytorch and a Tensorflow version in the respective lab folder. Since Pytorch and Tensorflow have slightly different
dependencies, this will all a user to setup a virtual environment for each "sub-lab".

Deep Learning Networks:

- Three layer fully connected network
- Binary Classifier
- Multiple Class Classifier
- Simple Image Classifier
