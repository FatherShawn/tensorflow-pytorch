I'm reading the pre-publication edition of [Deep Learning Design Patterns](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-design-patterns)
which uses Tensorflow-Keras as it's Python framework.  I usually work in Pytorch, so part of digesting the book for me is reworking all the
examples in Pytorch.  This repo is my lab for that and I'm sharing it in case it helps someone else.
